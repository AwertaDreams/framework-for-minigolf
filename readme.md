## Framework for minigolf
Framework for minigolf is a standalone tool for testing out gmod tower minigolf maps, and doesnt require user to host gmod tower in order to test minigolf maps.

## How do i install this?
1. Extract maps to ``GarrysMod\garrysmod\maps``
2. Extract folders from materials to ``GarrysMod\garrysmod\materials``
3. Make a folder inside ``GarrysMod\garrysmod\gamemodes`` called ``framework``. Extract ``entities, gamemode, framework.txt, icon24.png, logo.png, minigolf.fgd, minigolf.txt`` inside folder called ``framework``. It should look something like this:
![oexample](https://github.com/AwertaDreams/framework-for-minigolf/assets/134288412/4909c278-8ddd-43c6-9a18-26929ee3d112)
4. You're ready to go.

## Is there any guide on how to use this?
For now just decompile the map given inside the folder ``maps``, it should explain itself really easily. You also can mount hte ``minigolf.fgd`` onto hammer.
